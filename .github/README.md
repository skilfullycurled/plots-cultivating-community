## Cultivating Data/Cultivating Community: The Production of Community Through Data at Public Lab

These are the notebooks of the code from the project above a description of which can be found [here](https://publiclab.org/notes/bsugar/03-30-2019/cultivating-community-through-cultivating-data).

I need to find a place for the data, and I will try to annotate the notebooks in the future to be more "tutorial like".  In the meantime, once I find a place to house the data for download, if you simply want to create the outputs (see below) then you should be able make sure that the file paths point to the data files and run the notebooks as is (after installing any packages, of course).  I will also be posting tutorials for how to use [Gephi](https://gephi.org/), so stay tuned for that as well.

Many thanks to the Public Lab community, in particular the [developer community](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/).  I highly encourage programmers to check out the community.  You can read more about getting involved [here](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/#developers).  Additionally, if you are new to programming and/or Ruby (these notebooks are in Python) they have an excellant process for [first time contributers](https://code.publiclab.org/).  I had never contributed to a project before, and I did a "first time only" [issue](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/5412), made my first [pull request](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pull/5459) ever and it was a great experience!  You can get a feeling for the community by looking at past weekly check-in's or introduce yourself on the current one, the list of which can be found [here](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/5627).

Until then, here are some images which hopefully will make you subscribe or something like that so that you can be notified when the requisite pieces are up.
